# VARIABLE TYPES

---
# Variable Types
----
Each variable and the resulting data will be one of two types:
- **Qualitative** (*categorical*) or 
- **Quantitative** (*numerical*)

]
---
# Qualitative data
----
.pull-left[
- Nominal data
    - The categories are not ordered but simply have names. 
    - Examples include blood group (A, B, AB, and O).

- Binary (dichotomous) data  
    - There are only 2 possible categories for the variable. 
    - E.g Sex (male and female)
]
.pull-right[
- Ordinal data
    - the categories are ordered in some way. 
    - Examples include disease staging systems - Advanced, Moderate, Mild, none
]

---
Quantitative (*Numeric*)
----
.pull-left[
- Continuous 
    - Takes on any precision. 
    - Has no limitation to the values. 
    - E.g : Age of a person
]

.pull-right[
- Discrete  
    - Takes on certain specific (usually) whole numbers. 
    - Often a representation of a count of events. 
    - E.g. Number of cars
]
---
# Other data types
----
.pull-left[
- Percentages
    - Usually  stored as a quantitative but actually a fraction
    - 24% of 200 is not the same as 24% of 300.
    - E.g. Patient’s FEV1 increase by 24% following treatment with a new drug.
]

.pull-right[
- Ratios or quotients
    - Ratio of two variables
    - E.g incidence ratio, BMI

- Scores
    - Arbitrary values 
    - Not very meaningful
    - E.g: Pain score
]

---
# Group Work
----
- Be in your groups
- Give five examples each of the following variables:
    - Numeric 
        - Discrete numeric
        - Continuous numeric
    - Categorical data
        - Nominal
        - Ordinal 
    - Binary
    - Date and/or time
```{r}
library(countdown)
countdown(font_size = "100px",
  minutes = 10, 
  seconds = 0,
  color_border              = "red",
  color_text                = "red",
)
```

# Dependent & Independent variables
----
- **Independent** (predictor) variable 
    - Potentially influences, affects or predicts another variable
    - E.g: How age influences income make age the independent variable

- **Dependent** (predicted) variable 
    - Potentially predicted, influenced and affected by another variable
    - E.g: How age influences income make income the dependent variable

.activity[
Can we have volunteers  tell us about their .red[TOPIC], .red[INDEPENDENT] and .red[DEPENDENT] variables to be collected?
