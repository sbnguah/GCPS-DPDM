.title-text[VARIABLE TYPES]

---
# Variable Types
----
Each variable and the resulting data will be one of two types:
- **Qualitative** (*categorical*) or 
- **Quantitative** (*numerical*)

.center[
<img src="Images\variable_types.jpg" style="width: 70%" />
]
---
# Qualitative data
----
.pull-left[
- Nominal data
    - The categories are not ordered but simply have names. 
    - Examples include blood group (A, B, AB, and O).

- Binary (dichotomous) data  
    - There are only 2 possible categories for the variable. 
    - E.g Sex (male and female)
]
.pull-right[
- Ordinal data
    - the categories are ordered in some way. 
    - Examples include disease staging systems - Advanced, Moderate, Mild, none
]

---
Quantitative (*Numeric*)
----
.pull-left[
- Continuous 
    - Takes on any precision. 
    - Has no limitation to the values. 
    - E.g : Age of a person
]

.pull-right[
- Discrete  
    - Takes on certain specific (usually) whole numbers. 
    - Often a representation of a count of events. 
    - E.g. Number of cars
]
---
# Other data types
----
.pull-left[
- Percentages
    - Usually  stored as a quantitative but actually a fraction
    - 24% of 200 is not the same as 24% of 300.
    - E.g. Patient’s FEV1 increase by 24% following treatment with a new drug.
]

.pull-right[
- Ratios or quotients
    - Ratio of two variables
    - E.g incidence ratio, BMI

- Scores
    - Arbitrary values 
    - Not very meaningful
    - E.g: Pain score
]

---
# Group Work
----
- Be in your groups
- Give five examples each of the following variables:
    - Numeric 
        - Discrete numeric
        - Continuous numeric
    - Categorical data
        - Nominal
        - Ordinal 
    - Binary
    - Date and/or time
```{r}

# Dependent & Independent variables
----
- **Independent** (predictor) variable 
    - Potentially influences, affects or predicts another variable
    - E.g: How age influences income make age the independent variable

- **Dependent** (predicted) variable 
    - Potentially predicted, influenced and affected by another variable
    - E.g: How age influences income make income the dependent variable

&emsp; \[ &nbsp; &nbsp; \] &emsp; Pretty good <br>
&emsp; \[ &nbsp; &nbsp; \] &emsp; OK <br>

---
# Leading question?
----
### The response category should allow the respondents to like or disike the taste. A much better range would be
&emsp; \[ &nbsp; &nbsp; \] &emsp; I liked it very much <br>
&emsp; \[ &nbsp; &nbsp; \] &emsp; i quite liked it <br>
&emsp; \[ &nbsp; &nbsp; \] &emsp; i neither liked nor disliked it <br>

### how would you descrive the taste of our new icecream?
&emsp; \[ &nbsp; &nbsp; \] &emsp; I liked it very much <br>
&emsp; \[ &nbsp; &nbsp; \] &emsp; I quite liked it <br>
&emsp; \[ &nbsp; &nbsp; \] &emsp; I neither liked nor disliked it <br>
&emsp; \[ &nbsp; &nbsp; \] &emsp; I did not like it <br>
&emsp; \[ &nbsp; &nbsp; \] &emsp; It was awful <br>

---
# Open ended question?
----
- Leave adequate space
- Re-categorise in the  codebook
- Can be challenging
--

### Question: _How do you get to work?_
There is not reponse category but rather a box to enter free text response. The subject may now qualify this answer with...
>"Well, on a Monday I take the train. On Tuesday and Wednesday I get a lift, on Thursday I drive myself to work and on friday I work from home. So, I guess you could say I walk as my home office is in the summer house ae the end of the garden"

---
# Adding "Others" category
----
### How do you usually communicate with your friends?
&emsp; \[ 1 \] &emsp; By phone <br>
&emsp; \[ 2 \] &emsp; Text (SMS) <br>
&emsp; \[ 3 \] &emsp; email <br>
&emsp; \[ 4 \] &emsp; Letter <br>
&emsp; \[ 5 \] &emsp; Others, please specify:............................ <br>

# Questiannaire - General outlay to consider
----
- Main topics related to objectives
- Dependent variables
- Independent variables
- As much as possible open-ended questions first close ended last
- Section by section – Group related questions
- No unnecessary branching
- Interesting questions in the middle 3rd of questionnaire
- Always number questions
- Avoid splitting answer categories across two pages
- Add questions numbers, especially in large CRF. E.g q1a, q3c, Q2sex, q7time

# Conclusion
----
### A well designed questionnaire makes it
- Easy for respondent
- Easy for researcher
- Easy for statistician

- Used for data cleaning and analysis
- Not more than 8 characters
- Alpha –numeric  i.e. a-z and 0-9  and underscore (name_1)
- Avoid special characters (&^%#)
- Never begin with a number
- Remember they are case sensitive
    - Boy ≠ boy

---
#Variable names
----
- Use lowercase variable
- Should preferably be meaningful e.g. 
    - sex
    - age
    - weight
- May need to qualify many variables with similar names:  
    - q7a
    - q9b
- Three different dates of interview can be named as:
    - date1
    - date2 
    - date3

---
# Meaning
----
- Short phrase
- May be similar to a short question on questionnaire
- Describes the variable
- E.g.
