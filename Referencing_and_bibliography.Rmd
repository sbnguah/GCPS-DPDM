**Longer quotes**

- Usually indent
- No quotation marks
- Citation not in quotation

**Example** <br>
There are many definitions given to eating disorders but according to Osei:

.indent[
The eagerness of a person’s hunger pangs determines the amount of food eaten. This makes him a heavy eater if he eats all the portions served to him. He becomes full and does not want to eat again soon. Eating then is good for him.

(Osei, 2013)

>“There are many [.red[researchers]] who are not here.”

- Use of italics indicates your emphasis of words

>"WHO, together with partners, has developed technical guidance and training materials that can be used by countries to further strengthen their capacities to prepare and respond to disease .red[*outbreaks*], including Ebola virus disease, in accordance with the IHR (2005) core capacities requirements."

# Exercise
Where do we position the reference(s) in the paragraph below?

<style>

</style>

.q[
Most researchers agree that it is inappropriate to attempt to isolate a single main cause of an accident. However, earlier motor vehicle crash studies demonstrated that about 90% of all accidents could be attributed to road user characteristics. Hence, road user behavior is often examined for compliance with existing traffic rules and regulations. “Speed Kills” has been used for many years as an educational slogan to drive at reasonable speeds.

    - Not recommended for more than 3 references
- Software
    - A number of them
    - Offline  vrs Online
    - Free vrs commercial
