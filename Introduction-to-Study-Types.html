# Quantitative vrs Qualitative methods
- **Quantitative**
    - Involves measurement of outcomes using numerical data under standardized conditions 
    - May be used along the continuum of research
----
- **Qualitative**
    - Concerned with narrative information under less structured conditions that often takes the research context into account
        - Descriptive and exploratory research
        - Purposes: describing conditions, exploring associations, formulating theory, generating hypotheses

---
#Qualitative Studies
- Seeks to describe how individuals perceive experiences within a social context
- Emphasizes in-depth understanding of human experience and interactions
- Methods include:
    - In-depth interviews
    - Direct observations
    - Examining documents
    - Focus groups
    - Key informant interviews
    - Participant observations
- Data are often participants’ own words and narrative summaries of observed behavior

---
#Qualitative Studies
.pull-left[
**Strengths**
- In depth knowledge of the issues
- Useful for describing complex phenomenon
- Puts local context on the issues
- Easy to evaluate dynamic situations
]

.pull-right[
**Weakness**
- Knowledge may not be generalisable to other locations
- Difficult making quantitative predictions
- Might have lower credibility
- Results easily influenced by researchers opinion
- Complex analytical methods required for data obtained
]

---
# Case Report
.pull-left[
- Description of an individual's 
    - Case condition
    - Response to intervention 
- Can focus on
    - A group
    - Institution
    - School, 
    - Community, 
    - Family, 
    - etc
- Qualitative, quantitative, or both
]

.right[
&lt;img src="Images/case_report_article.jpg" style="width: 50%" /&gt;
]

---
# Case Series
- Observations of several similar cases are reported
- Descriptive study: Not designed to address a specific hypothesis
- Key features: Clear, reproducible case definition with a specific focus on place, person and time
- Addresses the 5 Ws quseitons:
    - Who
    - What
    - Why 
    - When 
    - Where
- Often the first approach taken and the resutls guides hypothesis formation

---
# Case Report/Series
- **Strengths**
    - Enables understanding of the totality of an individual’s (or organization, community) experience
    - The in-depth examination of a situation or ‘case’ can lead to discovery of relationships that were not obvious before
    -Useful for generating new hypotheses or for describing new phenomena
- **Weakness**
    - Weaknesses
    - No control group
    - Prone to selection bias and confounding
        - The interaction of environmental and personal characteristics make it weak in internal validity
    - Limited generalizability
    
---
# Cross-sectional Study
- Researcher studies a stratified group of subjects at one point in time
- Draws conclusions by comparing the characteristics of the stratified groups
- Well-suited to describing variables and their distribution patterns
- Can be used for examining associations; determination of which variables are predictors, and which are outcomes depends on the hypothesis:
    - *Does lead paint ingestion cause hyperactivity or does hyperactivity lead to lead paint ingestion?*

---
# Cross-sectional Study - example 
**What is the prevalence of chlamydia in women age 18-35 in Cleveland, and is it associated with the use of oral contraceptives?**

----
- Select a sample of 100 women attending an STD clinic in the city of Cleveland
- Measure the **predictor** and **outcome** variables by taking a history of oral contraceptive use and sending a cervical swab to the lab for chlamydia culture
- A questionnaire may be used to gather information abut oral contraceptive history

---
# Cross-sectional study
**Strengths**
- Fast and inexpensive
- No loss to follow-up (no follow-up)
- Ideal for studying prevalence
- Convenient for examining potential networks of causal links

**Weaknesses:**
- Difficult to establish a causal relationship between predictor and outcome variables 
- Does not establish sequence of events)
- Not practical for studying rare phenomena

---
# Cohort Study
**A group of individuals who do not yet have the outcome of interest are followed together over time to see who develops the condition**
- Participants are interviewed or observed to determine the presence or absence of certain exposures, risks, or characteristics
- May be simply descriptive 
- May identify risk by comparing the incidence of specific outcomes in exposed and not exposed participants

---
# Cohort Study - example
.center[**Objective: To determine whether exercise protects against coronary heart disease (CHD)**]
- Assemble the cohort: 16,936 Harvard alumni were enrolled
- Measure predictor variables: 
    - Administer a questionnaire about activity and other potential risk factors , collected data from college records
- 10 years later, sent a follow-up questionnaire about CHD and collected data about CHD from death certificates

---
#Cohort Study
**Strengths**
- Powerful strategy for defining incidence and investigating potential causes of an outcome before it occurs
- Time sequence strengthens inference that the factor may cause the outcome

**Weaknesses**
- Expensive, many subjects must be studied to observe outcome of interest
- Potential confounders: eg, cigarette smoking might confound the association between exercise and CHD

---
# Case-Control Study
- Generally retrospective
    - Identify groups
        - Cases
        - Controls (matched or unmatched)
    - Look backward in time to find differences in:
        - Predictor variables 
- **Assumption:** Differences in exposure =&gt; Different outcomes
- Data collection via:
    - Direct interview
    - Mailed questionnaire
    - Chart review
    - etc
    
---
#Case-Control Study
**Strengths**
- Rare conditions
- Short duration &amp; relatively inexpensive
- High yield of information from relatively few participants
- Useful for generating hypotheses

**Weaknesses**
- Increased susceptibility to bias
    - Separate sampling of cases and controls
    - Retrospective measurement of predictor variables
- No way to estimate the excess risk of exposure
- Only one outcome can be studied

---
#Case-Control Study - Example
.center[**Purpose:** To determine whether there is an association between the use of aspirin and the development of Reye’s syndrome in children.]

- **Draw the sample of cases** – 30 patients who have had Reye’s syndrome
- **Draw the sample of controls** – 60 patients from the much larger population who have had minor viral illnesses without Reye’s syndrome
- **Measure the predictor variable:** Ask patients in both groups about their use of aspirin

---
#Experimental studies
- To compare 2 or more groups by:
    - Randomization 
    - Non-randomization

**Assumption**: 
- The groups differ solely on the basis of what occurs between measurements (ie, intervention)    
- Changes from pretest to posttest can be reasonably attributed to the intervention
- Most basic is the pretest-posttest control group design (randomized controlled trial, RCT)

---
#Experimental studies - Example  
**Objectives:** &lt;br&gt;
Is regular exercise associated with improved depression, functional status, and quality of life of elderly.

**Population:** &lt;br&gt;
Elderly 70yrs and above with depression

**Intervention** &lt;br&gt;
Three times weekly scheduled exercises

**Method** &lt;br&gt;
70 elderly randomized to exercise and non-exercise groups

**Measures:** &lt;br&gt;Pre- and Post-Test evauation of outcome measures. 

---
#Experimental studies
**Strengths**
- Controls the influence of confounding variables
- Randomization eliminates bias
- Blinding the interventions eliminates bias

**Weaknesses**
- Costly in time and money
- Many research questions are not suitable for experimental designs
- Usually reserved for more mature research questions
- Experiments tend to restrict the scope and narrow the study question

---
# Quasi-Experimental studies
- Do not use randomized assignments for comparisons

---
#Systematic Review
.pull-left[
**1. Planning**
- Search for existing reviews &amp; protocols
- Formulate review question
- Develop review protocol
    
**2. Systematic Literature Search**
- Search strategy
- Systematically search databases and literature
- Download citation to a reference manager
]

.pull-right[
**3. Appraisal &amp; synthesis**
- Select studies
- Extract data
- Synthesize data

**4. Reporting findings**
- Writing the reviews
- Publishing
]

---
#Meta-analysis
- **Identify studies**
- **Determine eligibility**
    - Inclusions
    - Exclusions
- **Abstract data from studies**
- **Analyse data using requisite statistical methods**
