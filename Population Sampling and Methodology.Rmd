#Population
- **Target population:** Any specified group (usually large) of persons, things, or measurement values, e.g. the study population, the sampled population, the target population.

- **Study population:** This is a subset of a population, whose properties have been, or are to be, generalized to the larger population or set.

- **Sampling:** This is a process of picking a sample from the population.

- **Sample:** Members of the study population who are selected for the study. Should be representative of the target population

# Sampling
.pull-left[
##Non-Probability
- Convenience sampling
- Snowballing
- Quota sampling
- Purposive sampling
- Responder driven sampling (RDS)
]

.pull-right[
##Probability
- Simple random sampling
- Systematic sampling 
- Stratified sampling
- Cluster sampling 
- Multistage sampling
]

#Simple Random Sampling
<img src="Images\simple_random_sampling.png" style="width: 100%" />

---
## Simple Random Sampling
.pull-left[
### Advantages
- Minimal knowledge of group required
- Free from error of classification
- Suitable for data analysis
- Free from bias
- Simple to use
]

.pull-right[
### Disadvantages
- Population should not be dispersed
- Unusable in an heterogeneous
- Lacks use of available knowledge concerning population.
- Need for a well laid out sampling frame.
]

# Systematic Random Sampling
<img src="Images\systematic_random_sampling.jpg" style="width: 100%" />

---
##Systematic Random Sampling
.pull-left[
###Advantages
- Simple to implement
- Simple to design
- No need for a ssmpling frame
- Good coverage of study area
]

.pull-right[
###Disadvantages
- Might introduce bias
    - Trend
    - Periodicity
]

##Stratified Random Sampling
.pull-left[
###Advantages
- All groups included
- Statistical precision increased
]

.pull-right[
###Disadvantages
- Stratat might be difficult to determine
- Sampling error difficult to measure

#Convieneince sampling
**Collection of data from population that is convieniently avaiable to provide. Also called *"Accidental sampling"*.**
- **Advantages**
    - High participation rate
    - Easy to implement
    
- **Disadvantages**
    - Difficualt to generalise
    - Bias

## Snowballing Sampling 
<img src="Images\snowballing_sampling.jpg" style="width: 80%" />

---
# Bias in sampling
###Definition
Distortions that arise when a sample is not representative of the population from which it was drawn

###Sources
- Poor sampling technique
- Studying volunteers
- Non-response
- Seasonal bias
- “Convenience sampling”

**These should be reduced!**

# Sample Size

---
# Why bother
- Identify study population
- Draw a sample
- Describe sample (e.g mean)
- Make inferences about the whole population

##Sample size - how much?
.pull-left[
###Determinants
- Study objectives
- Type of study
- Study design
- Variables to be measured
- Achievability
]

.pull-right[
###Too little
- Not representative enough
- Cannot make reasonable conclusions about population
- Waste of resources
- Ethically improper 

###Too much
- Waste of resources
- Data redundancy
- Ethically improper

# Sample size - not one formula fits all!!!

.pull-left[
**Sample size to determine the average systolic blood pressure of KATH workers**
<br> <br>

$$ n = \frac{Z^2 \sigma^2}{E^2} $$
]

.pull-right[
**Sample size required to determine proportion of hypertensives in KATH**
<br>
$$ n = \frac{Z_\frac{1}{\alpha}^2 p (1-p)}{d^2} $$
]

#Sample size – Comparing 2 means 
-   $\mu_A$ is the mean in group A
-   $\mu_B$ is the mean in group B
-   $n_A$ is the sample size in first group
-   $n_B$ is the sample size in second group
-   $\kappa = \frac{n_A}{n_B}$ is the matching ratio
-   $\alpha$ is the type I error rate
-   $\beta$ is the type II error

$$n_A=\kappa n_B \;\text{ and }\;
        n_B=\left(1+\frac{1}{\kappa}\right)
            \left(\sigma\frac{z_{1-\alpha/2}+z_{1-\beta}}{\mu_A-\mu_B}\right)^2$$

---
# Case-control study

Using the formulas below by Campbell et al
$$n=\frac{[Z_{1-\alpha/2}\sqrt{2\bar{p}(1-\bar{p})}+Z_{1-\beta}\sqrt{p_A(1-p_A)+p_B(1-p_B)}]^2}{\delta^2}$$
and $$N=\frac{r+1}{2r}\times n$$

- Where: $p_A$ and $p_B$ is the prevalence of the complications in hypertensives and
non-hypertensives respectively.
- $\delta=p_A-p_B$, and $\bar{p}=\frac{(p_A+p_B)}{2}$,
$Z_{1-\alpha/2}=1.96$ and $Z_{1-\beta}=0.84$. $n$
